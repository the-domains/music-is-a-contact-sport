Ask any musician. Do they workout? Do they prepare? Do they visualize their performance? Do they practice? Do they prepare?

Musicians prepare both mentally and physically. Stretches, warm-ups, exercises and mini rehearsals are very common leading up to a performance. 

To hear a vocalist sing la-la-la-la-la prior to a solo or a vocal ensemble is very common. I'd argue as common as a sports athlete doing stretches and warm-ups on the sidelines prior to getting into the game.

It is common to see a duet, trio, quartet, or larger ensemble rehearsing common bits and phrases of a song, even after the "performance" of the music is completed.

The concept that music is a contact sport is a long-time thought process I have been working on and embracing for years and years. It takes as much physical and mental preparation and prowess to perform for an audience small or large as it does to win a championship in any sport.

In music is a contact sport, you will see a showcase of this premise lived out in real life among musicians from the true Amateur to the professional.
